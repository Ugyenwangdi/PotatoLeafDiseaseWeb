# Problem statement

Plant diseases contribute to major yield losses. Every year, farmers face economic loss and crop failure due to various
diseases in potato plants. In developing countries such as Bhutan, plant diseases are detected
manually by trained professionals who monitor crop fields and examine potato foliage. This
task is extremely monotonous, in some cases it is inconvenient due to the absence of
professionals in remote regions. However, advances in image processing, and deep learning in
disease recognition of plant leaves using images can make the process much more efficient
and timely.

# About Project:

A project that was aimed to classify the disease of a potato leaf and  suggest the treatment for a leaf disease.This project is developed by a team of students at GCIT and the app uses Googleâ€™s Tensorflow machine learning tool. It was implemented using image classification and deep learning. The app allows you to capture the image of a leaf or upload from your device and classify.

We also created an API of our project and deployed it to [RapidAPI](https://rapidapi.com/Ugyenwangdi/api/kewa-doctor/)
